The Lazy Farmer Flag Game
-------------------------

Made for James Grime - [see the video at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMkziQhJkmM).

The aim is to place flags on a field of length 1, so that when you divide the field into equal-sized plots, there's exactly one flag in each field. To complicate matters, you place the flags one-by-one, and you check whether the placements are valid after each flag goes down.
